WEEE Open Game - Developed by WEEE Open student team, 2024

-- How does this works?
The root of the project is the index.html file, which loads each js module from the /src folder.
The modules loaded are, in order:
1. Utils (utils.js)
2. Assets (assets.js)
3. Scenes (scene_xxx.js)
4. Transition (transition.js)
5. Main (main.js)
6. Inputs (inputs.js)
Let's see these modules more in details.

-- 1. Utils
Contains general global functions that can be useful while coding and that do not require any declared constant/variable.
Usually Utils contains math functions and other frequent operations.

-- 2. Assets
-- 2.1. Global variables and functions
-- 2.2. Resources
-- 2.3. Rendering properties and functions

-- 3. Scenes
List of scenes in the format scene_xxx. Each scene must implement four methods:
-- 3.1. xxxSceneInit()
-- 3.2. xxxSceneKeyPress(key)
-- 3.3. xxxSceneKeyRelease(key)
-- 3.4. xxxSceneLoop()

-- 4. Transition
It's a "special scene" that overlaps others while changing a scene.
It does not have methods about inputs (key press, key release)

-- 5. Main
It's the "global scene" that executes the code in each one of the four methods regardless of which scene is active

-- 6. Inputs
Contains the listeners for input events.
Moreover it separates functions to be called before and after that the page is fully loaded.
